## 🚀 **CrewAI Use Cases**

### **1. Content Writer Agent**  
An autonomous writing assistant capable of generating high-quality blogs, articles, and marketing copy with research-backed accuracy.

### **2. Customer Support Agent**  
Automates Tier-1 support, FAQ answering, troubleshooting workflows, and customer intent detection—reducing response times and improving CX.

### **3. Sales Outreach Agent**  
Personalizes outbound messages, sequences, and follow-ups by analyzing ICPs, buyer personas, and past interactions.

### **4. Event Planning Agent**  
End-to-end agent for scheduling, vendor management, budget planning, and logistics support.

### **5. Multi-Agent Financial Analysis**  
A coordinated system of analysts, reviewers, and strategy agents working together to interpret financial statements and generate insights.

## 🧩 **OpenAI Agents SDK**

### **1. Agent Handoff**  
Seamless transfer of context and tasks between specialized agents—for example, from a sales agent to an onboarding agent.

### **2. Agents as Tools**  
Agents invoked as callable functions within other agents, enabling modular and reusable AI workflows.

### **3. LLM as Judge**  
A quality-assurance layer where an independent LLM evaluates outputs against predefined criteria (accuracy, tone, relevance, safety).

## 🔬 **Research Bot**

### **Multi-Agent Research System**  
A deeply extensible research architecture built with:  
- Specialized roles (Researcher, Summarizer, Verifier, Strategist)  
- Automated source gathering  
- Cross-validation between agents  
- **Extended using Temporal** for durable workflows and long-running research tasks  

This system is ideal for competitive analysis, market research, and scientific exploration.
